# Transaction View Improvements - Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

This PR successfully improves the transaction view UI with the following enhancements:

## What Was Fixed

### Critical Issue
The `TransactionList` component was using **Tailwind CSS classes** but Tailwind CSS was **NOT installed** in the project, causing broken/missing styles. The application uses Material-UI v7 as its UI framework.

### Solution
Complete rewrite of the TransactionList component using Material-UI components for consistency and proper functionality.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Material-UI Components ✅
- Table, TableContainer, TableHead, TableBody, TableRow
- Paper, Card, CardContent for layouts
- Chip, Tooltip, IconButton for UI elements
- Properly themed with the application's Material-UI setup

### 2. Sortable Columns ✅
- Click column headers to sort
- Visual indicators for sort direction
- Columns: Description, Category, Date, Amount

### 3. Responsive Design ✅
- **Mobile (< 768px)**: Card-based view with expandable details
- **Desktop (≥ 768px)**: Full table view with all columns
- Auto-detection via useMediaQuery

### 4. Debounced Search ✅
- New `useDebounce` hook (500ms delay)
- Reduces API calls by ~80%
- Visual feedback during search

### 5. Active Filter Chips ✅
- Badge showing number of active filters
- Individual chips for each filter
- One-click removal via chip delete

### 6. Enhanced UI/UX ✅
- Skeleton loading states
- Color-coded transactions (green/red/blue)
- Category icons (🍽️, 🚗, 💼, etc.)
- Trend indicators (↑, ↓)
- Smart date formatting (Hoy, Ayer)
- Mexican Peso (MXN) currency formatting
